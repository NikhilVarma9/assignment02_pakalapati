#### The Field Museum 

 The Field Museum is still very much worthy of **attention**.<br> With museums, fossils and **archaeological artifacts** from around the world, the Field brings together the past and the present.<br> One of its most interesting aspects is its focus on the effects of ***climate change*** and what that means for the current world.
